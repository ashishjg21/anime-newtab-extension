## Personal Notes 
Without package.lock.json, there might be some differences in installed versions in different environments. To overcome this problem, package.lock.json is created to have the same results in every environment. It should be in source control with the package.json file because if any other user will clone the project and install dependencies then it will install the exact same dependencies as in package.lock.json to avoid differences.
